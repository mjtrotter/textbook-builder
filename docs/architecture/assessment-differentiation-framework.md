# Assessment & Differentiation Framework

A growth-focused approach aligned with MAP Growth, Zone of Proximal Development research, and Christian classical education principles.

---

## Core Philosophy: Growth Over Proficiency

### The Shift

**Traditional Assessment**:
```
"Did the student master this content?" (binary)
"Is the student at grade level?" (comparison)
```

**Growth-Based Assessment**:
```
"Where is the student now?" (RIT/ZPD)
"What can they learn next?" (learning continuum)
"How much have they grown?" (trajectory)
```

### Biblical Foundation

Christian classical education views assessment as stewardship - helping each student develop the gifts God has given them, not comparing students to each other.

> "Train up a child in the way he should go" (Proverbs 22:6)

The "way he should go" is individual - each child's unique path of development, not a standardized timeline.

---

## MAP Growth Integration

### Understanding RIT Scores

**What RIT Measures**:
- The difficulty level of questions a student answers correctly ~50% of the time
- A stable, equal-interval scale across grades and years
- Growth over time, not just point-in-time proficiency

**Key Insight**: A student's RIT score indicates their Zone of Proximal Development - the sweet spot where learning happens with appropriate support.

### Learning Continuum Alignment

MAP Growth provides a Learning Continuum that shows skills within 10-point RIT bands. This curriculum aligns content to RIT bands rather than just grade levels:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              RIT-BASED LEARNING PATHS                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                              │
│  Student A (3rd grader, RIT 195 in math):                    │
│  → Working with Grade 3-4 fraction concepts                  │
│                                                              │
│  Student B (3rd grader, RIT 210 in math):                    │
│  → Working with Grade 5 ratio/proportion concepts            │
│                                                              │
│  Same classroom, different learning paths based on ZPD       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Instructional Use of MAP Data

**Three Questions MAP Helps Answer**:

1. **Where to Reinforce**: Skills below the student's RIT (automaticity building)
2. **Where to Develop**: Skills at the student's RIT (active instruction zone)
3. **Where to Introduce**: Skills above the student's RIT (stretch goals)

### Sample RIT Alignment Table (Mathematics)

| RIT Band | Grade Equivalent | Core Concepts | Logic Integration |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 161-170 | K-1 | Counting, basic addition | Sorting, classifying |
| 171-180 | 1-2 | Place value, 2-digit operations | Patterns |
| 181-190 | 2-3 | 3-digit operations, intro fractions | Analogies |
| 191-200 | 3-4 | Fractions, multi-digit multiplication | Sequences, pre-logic |
| 201-210 | 4-5 | Decimals, fraction operations | Formal logic intro |
| 211-220 | 5-6 | Ratios, integers, pre-algebra | Categorical reasoning |
| 221-230 | 6-7 | Algebraic expressions, equations | Deductive reasoning |
| 231-240 | 7-8 | Linear functions, geometry | Proof introduction |
| 241+ | 8+ | Algebra II, advanced geometry | Formal proof |

---

## Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)

### Definition

The ZPD is the space between what a learner can do independently and what they can do with guidance. It's where real learning happens.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Can't do even with help                        │
│   (Frustration Zone)                             │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Can do with scaffolding                        │
│   ★ ZONE OF PROXIMAL DEVELOPMENT ★               │
│   (Learning Zone - where instruction targets)    │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Can do independently                           │
│   (Comfort Zone - for automaticity)              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### ZPD and MAP Growth Connection

**MAP Growth identifies the ZPD through adaptive testing**:
- Items student answers correctly → below ZPD (mastered)
- Items student answers incorrectly → above ZPD (not ready)
- 50% threshold → edge of ZPD (instructional target)

### Instructional Response

| Student Zone | Teacher Action | Student Experience |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Below ZPD | Build fluency/automaticity | Success, confidence |
| In ZPD | Direct instruction + scaffolding | Productive struggle |
| Above ZPD | Preview/exposure only | Awareness, not mastery |

## Differentiation Model

### Tomlinson's Framework Applied

**Differentiate by**:
- **Content**: What students learn
- **Process**: How students learn it
- **Product**: How students demonstrate learning
- **Environment**: Where/when learning happens

### Our Three-Tier Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                         CORE                                 │
│   Essential learning aligned with grade-level standards      │
│   All students engage with this content                      │
│   Differentiated by PROCESS (scaffolding, pacing)            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        │                                         │
        ▼                                         ▼
┌───────────────────────┐         ┌───────────────────────────┐
│      SUPPORT          │         │      ENRICHMENT           │
│                       │         │                           │
│ Additional scaffolds  │         │ Deeper exploration        │
│ Pre-teaching          │         │ Broader connections       │
│ Alternative pathways  │         │ Complex applications      │
│ Extended time         │         │ Creative extensions       │
└───────────────────────┘         └───────────────────────────┘

                    ↓ (Math only) ↓

         ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
         │        ACCELERATION              │
         │                                  │
         │ Advance to next content level    │
         │ Competition mathematics          │
         │ College-level courses            │
         └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Flexible Grouping

**Key Principle**: Grouping is fluid, not fixed.

Students move between groups based on:
- Current skill being taught
- Demonstrated mastery
- Learning preference for this unit
- Interest in topic

**Not** permanent ability tracks like "bluebirds and buzzards."

### Differentiation by Content Strand

| Strand | Support | Core | Enrichment | Acceleration |
|--------|---------|------|------------|--------------|
| Math | Scaffolded problems, manipulatives | Grade-level curriculum | Complex problems, investigations | Next grade level + competition |
| History | Simplified sources, visual supports | Primary source analysis | Multiple perspectives, historiography | — |
| Science | Guided inquiry, structured labs | Standard investigation | Independent research, extended inquiry | — |
| Grammar | Explicit instruction, extra practice | Standard progression | Advanced composition, Latin extensions | — |
| Bible | Supported reading, oral discussion | Standard study | Theological depth, apologetics | — |

## Assessment Types

### Formative Assessment (Daily)

**Purpose**: Adjust instruction in real time

**Methods**:
- Exit tickets
- Whiteboard responses
- Thumbs up/down
- Quick writes
- Observation during work time
- Student self-assessment

**Frequency**: Every lesson
**Grading**: Not graded (or completion only)

### Interim Assessment (Periodic)

**Purpose**: Check progress toward goals, adjust grouping

**Methods**:
- MAP Growth testing (Fall, Winter, Spring)
- Unit assessments
- Skill checks
- Performance tasks

**Frequency**: Every 6-8 weeks
**Grading**: Scored for feedback, may count in grade

### Summative Assessment (End of Unit)

**Purpose**: Document mastery, communicate achievement

**Methods**:
- Chapter/unit tests
- Projects
- Papers
- Presentations
- Portfolios

**Frequency**: End of unit
**Grading**: Counts toward grade

---

## Developmental Stage Expectations

### Grammar Stage (K-4): Growth Focus

**Assessment Philosophy**:
- Emphasize GROWTH over proficiency
- Celebrate progress on individual trajectories
- Avoid ranking/comparison between students
- Focus on skill development, not content memorization

**What We Measure**:
- RIT growth from fall to spring (MAP)
- Skill progression in reasoning, writing, oratory
- Habits of work and virtue development
- Fluency development (reading, math facts)

**What We De-emphasize**:
- "Grade-level" as pass/fail threshold
- Retention of specific historical facts
- Standardized test percentiles (use growth percentiles)

### Logic Stage (5-8): Balanced Focus

**Assessment Philosophy**:
- Balance growth measurement with proficiency expectations
- Content mastery expectations increase
- Begin preparation for standardized tests
- Formal grading scales introduced

**What We Measure**:
- Continued RIT growth
- Content mastery on unit assessments
- Quality of reasoning and argumentation
- Writing sophistication

### Rhetoric Stage (9-12): Mastery Focus

**Assessment Philosophy**:
- College-preparatory rigor
- Deep content mastery expected
- Original thesis and research
- Transcripts and GPAs matter

**What We Measure**:
- Course grades
- AP/college exam scores
- Research quality
- Oral defense capability

## Biblical Integration in Assessment

### Assessing Worldview Formation

**Not just content, but formation**:

Rather than only testing "What did David do?" we also assess:
- Can student articulate how this passage reveals God's character?
- Can student connect this to other Scripture?
- Can student apply this principle to contemporary situations?
- Can student identify competing worldviews?

### Virtue Development

Classical Christian education assesses not just knowledge but virtue:

| Virtue | Observable Indicators | Assessment Method |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Diligence | Quality of work, attention to detail | Rubrics, observation |
| Humility | Receives correction, serves others | Teacher observation |
| Integrity | Honest work, owns mistakes | Self-assessment, observation |
| Perseverance | Works through difficulty | Process observation |
| Respect | Treatment of others, property | Behavioral assessment |

### Avoiding Moralistic Assessment

**We DO NOT**:
- Give grades based on spiritual performance
- Test for "correct" emotions
- Penalize honest doubt or questions

**We DO**:
- Assess understanding of biblical content
- Evaluate quality of theological reasoning
- Provide feedback on worldview articulation

---

## Growth Reporting

### Growth Metrics Over Percentiles

**Traditional Report Card**:
```
Math: B+ (87%)
Reading: A- (92%)
```

**Growth-Based Report Card**:
```
Math:
  - Fall RIT: 195 | Spring RIT: 208 | Growth: +13 (Above Average)
  - Working on: Fraction operations, decimal concepts
  - Next: Ratio and proportion
  - Strength: Problem-solving
  - Growth area: Computational fluency

Reading:
  - Fall RIT: 201 | Spring RIT: 210 | Growth: +9 (Average)
  - Working on: Inferential comprehension, source analysis
  - Reading in: Colonial history, biology
  - Strength: Vocabulary
  - Growth area: Supporting claims with evidence
```

### Parent Communication

**Growth Mindset Framing**:
- "Your child grew 13 RIT points this year"
- "This puts them on track to reach __ by end of next year"
- "They're working in their ZPD on fraction operations"

**Avoid**:
- "Your child is below grade level" (deficit framing)
- Comparison to other students
- Fixed ability language ("your child isn't a math person")
