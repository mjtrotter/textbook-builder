# Unified Skills Framework

A skills-first approach to educational content that develops transferable competencies across all subjects and levels.

---

## Paradigm Shift: Skills Over Knowledge

### Traditional Approach (Rejected)
```
Grade 3 Math → Grade 4 Math → Grade 5 Math
(focus: age-appropriate knowledge)
```

### Unified Approach (Adopted)
```
Reasoning Skills → Applied in Math, Science, History, Language Arts
(focus: transferable skills expressed through domain knowledge)
```

**Core Principle**: Knowledge is the vehicle; skills are the destination. A student learning to analyze patterns in mathematics is developing the same analytical skill they'll use to analyze historical events, scientific data, or literary themes.

## Skills Integration Matrix

Every lesson should develop multiple skills simultaneously. Here's how skills naturally cluster:

### Primary Clusters

**Analytical Cluster**:
- Reasoning & Logic
- Analysis & Interpretation
- Visualization & Spatial Thinking

**Productive Cluster**:
- Communication & Expression
- Problem-Solving & Design
- Collaboration & Social Cognition

**Executive Cluster**:
- Metacognition & Self-Regulation
- (supports all other skills)

### Lesson Design Pattern

```
Every lesson explicitly develops:
├── 1 Primary Skill (deep focus)
├── 1-2 Secondary Skills (supporting role)
└── Metacognition (always present)
```

## Skill Progression Indicators

### What Progression Looks Like

| Indicator | Lower Levels | Higher Levels |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Scaffolding | Heavy support | Independent |
| Complexity | Single-step | Multi-step, nested |
| Context | Familiar, concrete | Abstract, novel |
| Transfer | Guided | Spontaneous |
| Metacognition | External | Internalized |
| Precision | Approximate | Rigorous |
| Integration | Isolated skills | Coordinated skills |

### Assessment of Skill Progression

Skills are assessed through **performance tasks**, not just knowledge tests:

```
Reasoning Example:
- Level 3: "Complete this logical argument"
- Level 5: "Evaluate this argument for fallacies"

Visualization Example:
- Level 3: "Draw a diagram showing the relationship"
- Level 5: "Create a visualization for this complex data"
- Level 6: "Design an interactive model"
```

| Music (K-2) | Band 1 | Rhythm patterns, melodic patterns |
| Science (3-5) | Band 2 | Life cycle patterns, weather patterns |
| History (3-5) | Band 2 | Pattern of events, cause-effect chains |
| Math (6-8) | Band 3 | Function patterns, algebraic sequences |
| Literature (6-8) | Band 3 | Story patterns, character development |
| Biology (9-10) | Band 4 | Genetic patterns, population patterns |

**Knowledge** provides the context and content through which skills are developed and demonstrated. **Skills** are the transferable capabilities that persist across contexts.

## Implementation in Content Generation

### Lesson Metadata Requirements

Every generated lesson must specify:

```yaml
lesson:
  title: "Linear Equations"
  domain: "mathematics"
  grade_band: 4  # (9-10)

  primary_skill:
    skill: "reasoning"
    sub_skill: "algebraic_reasoning"
    progression_level: 4

  secondary_skills:
    - skill: "problem_solving"
      sub_skill: "strategy_selection"
    - skill: "communication"
      sub_skill: "mathematical_writing"

  skill_objectives:
    - "Use inverse operations to isolate variables (Reasoning)"
    - "Select appropriate solution strategies (Problem-Solving)"
    - "Explain solution steps clearly (Communication)"

  knowledge_objectives:
    - "Solve one-variable linear equations"
    - "Verify solutions by substitution"

  cross_curricular_connections:
    - domain: "science"
      topic: "balancing chemical equations"
      shared_skill: "algebraic_reasoning"
    - domain: "economics"
      topic: "supply-demand equilibrium"
      shared_skill: "algebraic_reasoning"
```

### Content Generation Prompts

When generating content, agents are instructed to:

1. **Lead with skill, not just content**:
   - "You're teaching *reasoning through* linear equations"
   - Not: "You're teaching linear equations"

2. **Explicitly name skills**:
   - "Notice how we're using *inverse operation reasoning* here"
   - Make metacognition visible

3. **Connect to other domains**:
   - "This same reasoning appears when scientists balance equations"

4. **Assess skills, not just knowledge**:
   - "Explain your reasoning" (not just "give the answer")

## Transferable Skill Indicators by Domain

### How the Same Skill Manifests Across Domains

**Skill: Causal Reasoning**

| Domain | Indicator |
|--------|-----------|
| Math | "If x increases, then y..." (function behavior) |
| Science | "Because the temperature increased, the gas expanded" |
| History | "The economic depression led to political instability" |
| Literature | "The character's jealousy caused them to act..." |
| CS | "Because this loop doesn't terminate, the program hangs" |

**Skill: Evidence Evaluation**

| Domain | Indicator |
|--------|-----------|
| Math | Checking solution by substitution |
| Science | Evaluating experimental data reliability |
| History | Assessing primary source credibility |
| Literature | Finding textual evidence for interpretation |
| CS | Debugging with test cases |

---

## Assessment Philosophy

### Skills-Based Assessment Principles

1. **Performance over recall**: Assess what students can DO, not just what they know
2. **Transfer tasks**: Require application in novel contexts
3. **Process visibility**: Require explanation of reasoning
4. **Multiple domains**: Test same skill across subjects
5. **Progression tracking**: Monitor skill development over time

### Sample Cross-Domain Assessment

**Skill Being Assessed**: Pattern Recognition & Generalization (Level 4)

```
Part A (Mathematics):
Examine this sequence: 2, 6, 18, 54, ...
Describe the pattern and write a general formula.

Part B (Science):
This graph shows bacterial population over time.
Describe the pattern and predict population at hour 10.

Part C (History):
These excerpts describe events in three different revolutions.
Identify the common pattern across all three.

Part D (Reflection):
What did you notice about the pattern-finding process
across these different contexts? What strategies helped?
```

**Scoring**: Each part is scored on the same skill rubric, allowing comparison across domains.
