# Classical-Modern Hybrid Curriculum Framework

A developmental curriculum that combines classical education principles (Trivium) with modern pedagogical research, focusing on transferable skills over isolated content mastery in early years.

---

## Core Philosophy

### Reading Is Not a Subject

**Traditional Approach** (Rejected):
```
Subjects: Reading, Writing, Math, Science, Social Studies
(reading taught in isolation with contrived passages)
```

**Classical-Modern Approach** (Adopted):
```
Content Strands: Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, History, Language Arts, Bible
Skill Strands: Reading, Writing, Reasoning, Discovery, Oratory
(reading is a SKILL applied to REAL content)
```

**Key Insight**: No child learns to read by reading "reading passages." They learn to read by reading *about* something worth knowing. Reading comprehension develops through engagement with substantial content in history, science, biography, and literature.

### The Developmental Progression

## The Five Content Strands

### 1. MATHEMATICS
**Includes**: Arithmetic, Geometry, Algebra, Logic, Statistics, Calculus

**Classical Integration**:
- Formal logic taught as mathematics (Grade 4+)
- Euclidean geometry with proofs (Grade 5+)
- Mathematical reasoning emphasized over computation

**Unique Differentiation**:
Mathematics is the one subject where acceleration is primary differentiation. Students who master quickly don't do "more of the same" - they advance.

```
CORE Track           ACCELERATION Track
─────────────        ─────────────────
Grade 3: ×/÷         Grade 3: Pre-Algebra concepts
Grade 4: Fractions   Grade 4: MOEMS preparation
Grade 5: Decimals    Grade 5: Algebra I + MATHCOUNTS
Grade 6: Pre-Alg     Grade 6: Geometry + competition
Grade 7: Algebra I   Grade 7: Algebra II + AMC 8
Grade 8: Geometry    Grade 8: Pre-Calculus + AMC 10
```

**Competition Pathway**:
- Grades 3-5: Math Olympiad for Elementary Schools (MOEMS)
- Grades 6-8: MATHCOUNTS, AMC 8
- Grades 9-12: AMC 10/12, AIME, USA(J)MO
- Putnam preparation for advanced students

---

### 2. NATURAL PHILOSOPHY (Science)
**Includes**: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Earth Science, Astronomy

**Classical Framing**:
"Natural Philosophy" rather than "Science" - the study of the natural world through observation, reason, and wonder.

**Early Years (K-4)**:
- Nature study and observation journals
- Scientific method as discovery process
- Broad exposure to all domains
- Reading: biographies of scientists, nature narratives
- Emphasis on *noticing* and *questioning*

**Logic Stage (5-8)**:
- Formal classification systems
- Causal reasoning and hypothesis testing
- Laboratory methodology
- Integration with mathematics

**Rhetoric Stage (9-12)**:
- College-level: Biology, Chemistry, Physics
- Research projects and original investigation
- Scientific writing and argumentation

---

### 3. HISTORY & GEOGRAPHY
**Includes**: World History, American History, Geography, Civics, Economics

**Classical Approach**: History as narrative, not facts
- Stories of people, decisions, consequences
- Primary source engagement from earliest grades
- Chronological cycling (ancients → modern, repeated)

**Four-Year Cycle** (repeated at increasing depth):
```
Year 1: Ancient (Creation - 400 AD)
Year 2: Medieval (400 - 1600)
Year 3: Early Modern (1600 - 1850)
Year 4: Modern (1850 - Present)

Students cycle through twice:
- Grades 1-4: Narrative focus, broad strokes
- Grades 5-8: Analysis focus, primary sources
- Grades 9-12: College historiography, original research
```

**Reading Integration**:
All "reading comprehension" in early years comes from historical narratives, biographies, and primary sources - not isolated reading passages.

---

## The Four Skill Strands

These skills are developed through ALL content strands, not as isolated subjects.

### 1. READING
**Not a subject - a skill developed through substantial content**

**Progression**:
- **K-1**: Phonics and decoding through quality literature

## Differentiation Framework

### Three Tiers (Not Tracks)

**CORE**: The essential learning all students master
**ENRICHMENT**: Deeper exploration, broader connections
**SUPPORT**: Additional scaffolding and practice

Students move fluidly between tiers by unit, not permanently tracked.

### Special Case: Mathematics

Math is the exception because mathematical ability genuinely varies in *pace* of development.

**Math Differentiation Model**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CORE TRACK: Grade-level mathematics                        │
│  All students master grade-level content                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         │
         ├── ENRICHMENT: Deeper problem-solving within level
         │
         └── ACCELERATION: Advance to next level
              │
              └── COMPETITION: Math Olympiad, MATHCOUNTS, AMC
```

**Acceleration Criteria**:
- Demonstrated mastery (>90% on level assessments)
- Strong problem-solving ability
- Student interest and family support

**Competition Track Details**:

| Grade | Competition | Preparation Focus |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 3-5 | MOEMS | Creative problem-solving |
| 6-8 | MATHCOUNTS | Speed, accuracy, team competition |
| 6-8 | AMC 8 | Mathematical reasoning |
| 9-10 | AMC 10 | Advanced problem-solving |
| 11-12 | AMC 12, AIME | Olympiad-style mathematics |

---

## Assessment Philosophy

### Early Years (K-4): Skills Over Content Mastery

**What We DON'T Do**:
- Standardized content tests measuring narrow facts
- Retention quizzes on specific historical dates
- "Reading level" tests divorced from content

**What We DO**:
- Assess skill development (reasoning, writing, oratory)
- Assess process (scientific method, historical thinking)
- Assess habits (curiosity, perseverance, attention)
- Narration and demonstration over multiple-choice

**Why**:
Content knowledge in early years is *scaffolding* - it's the material on which skills develop. A child who forgets the names of Egyptian pharaohs but learned to analyze primary sources has succeeded.

### Middle Years (5-8): Skills + Developing Mastery

- Formal assessments begin
- Content mastery expectations increase
- Skills remain primary but content accountability grows
- Standardized test preparation begins (but doesn't dominate)

### High School (9-12): Deep Mastery

- College-level expectations
- AP and college credit courses
- Comprehensive examinations
- Original thesis projects

## Sample Scope and Sequence

### Grade 3 Example Week

| Day | Math | Nat. Phil. | History | Language | Bible |
|-----|------|------------|---------|----------|-------|
| Mon | Multiplication concepts | Animal classification | Ancient Egypt daily life | Latin roots: "aqua" family | Joseph narrative |
| Tue | Arrays and groups | Animal habitats | Nile River geography | Grammar: nouns | Joseph narrative |
| Wed | Word problems | Food chains | Pyramid construction | Writing: narration | Memory: Psalm 23 |
| Thu | Logic: patterns | Predator/prey | Egyptian gods vs. Yahweh | Spelling patterns | Joseph narrative |
| Fri | Problem-solving | Nature journal | Historical fiction read-aloud | Oratory: recitation | Review/application |

**Note**: "Reading" doesn't appear because reading happens in Natural Philosophy (science texts), History (narratives), and Bible (Scripture). Writing includes the "grammar" instruction.
