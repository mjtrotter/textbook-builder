## Philosophy

### Why Latin?

1. **English vocabulary**: 60%+ of English words derive from Latin; academic vocabulary is 90%+ Latin/Greek
2. **Grammar mastery**: Latin's inflected structure develops deep understanding of English grammar
3. **Cognitive development**: Translation develops analytical thinking, attention to detail, precision
4. **Cultural literacy**: Access to foundational Western texts in their original language
5. **Academic preparation**: Strong predictor of SAT verbal scores and college success
6. **Historical continuity**: Connection to the Great Conversation across millennia

### Integration Philosophy

Latin is NOT a separate "foreign language" subject. It is:
- **Integral to Grammar strand**: Latin grammar illuminates English grammar
- **Connected to History**: Roman history and classical texts
- **Foundation for Science**: Scientific nomenclature and terminology
- **Preparation for Philosophy**: Original philosophical texts
