# Competition Mathematics Pathway

Structured acceleration track for mathematically talented students, from MOEMS through USAMO.

---

## Philosophy

### Why Competition Math?

1. **True differentiation**: Students who master quickly advance rather than doing "more of the same"
2. **Problem-solving depth**: Competition problems develop creativity and persistence
3. **Mathematical maturity**: Exposure to beautiful mathematics beyond standard curriculum
4. **Community**: Students find peers who share their passion

### Who Qualifies?

**Entry Criteria**:
- Consistent 90%+ on grade-level assessments
- Strong problem-solving interest (not just computation speed)
- Self-motivation and persistence with challenging problems
- Family support for additional practice

**Not Required**:
- Perfect scores on everything
- Early identification (students can enter at any level)
