# Parent Communication and Reporting Templates

Comprehensive templates for growth-focused communication with families throughout the K-12 journey.

---

## Philosophy

### Communication Principles

1. **Growth over proficiency**: Especially K-4, we emphasize progress, not fixed marks
2. **Narrative over numbers**: Stories capture learning better than grades
3. **Partnership**: Parents are allies, not audience
4. **Encouragement**: We call students higher while celebrating progress
5. **Honesty**: Clear communication about concerns and next steps
6. **Consistency**: Regular rhythm of communication, not just problems

### What We Communicate

- **Academic progress**: Skills, content, habits
- **Character growth**: Virtues, social development
- **Effort and engagement**: Process, not just outcomes
- **Next steps**: Specific goals and support needed
- **Celebrations**: Achievements and growth moments

## Specialized Communications

### MAP Growth Results Letter

```
Dear [Parent Names],

Your child recently took the MAP Growth assessment in [subjects]. Here's what the results show:

WHAT IS MAP?
MAP Growth measures academic growth over time. Rather than showing whether
your child is "on grade level" (which varies by comparison group), it shows
their individual growth trajectory and identifies their Zone of Proximal
Development—what they're ready to learn next.

[STUDENT]'S RESULTS:

Mathematics:
- RIT Score: [X]
- Fall-to-[Winter/Spring] Growth: +[X] (typical is +[X])
- Zone of Proximal Development: [Range]
- Key skills ready to develop: [List from report]

Reading:
- RIT Score: [X]
- Growth: +[X] (typical is +[X])
- ZPD: [Range]
- Key skills ready to develop: [List]

WHAT THIS MEANS:
[Interpretation tailored to student—celebrating growth, noting areas for
focus, explaining any concerns]

HOW WE'RE RESPONDING:
[Instructional adjustments based on data]

HOME SUPPORT:
[Specific suggestions aligned with ZPD]

I'm happy to discuss these results further at conference or by appointment.

[Teacher Name]
```

### Differentiation Communication

**When student is receiving support or enrichment:**

```
Dear [Parent Names],

[Student's strengths and needs in this area]

OUR RESPONSE:
[Description of differentiation—support group, enrichment, acceleration]

This is NOT:
- A label or permanent track
- A sign of failure [for support] or pressure [for enrichment]
- A reason for concern

This IS:
- Responsive teaching to meet [Student] where [he/she] is
- Temporary—we'll adjust as [he/she] grows
- Designed to challenge appropriately and build confidence

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
[What this looks like in practice]

HOW YOU CAN HELP:
[Home support specific to the differentiation]

Questions? Please reach out.
