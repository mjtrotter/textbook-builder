**Example Adaptation**:

*Original (Douglass, 1852)*:
"What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim."

*Adapted (Grade 3)*:
"What is your 4th of July to the American slave? I answer: a day that shows him the terrible unfairness and cruelty he suffers every day."

*Note*: Even the adapted version preserves Douglass's powerful voice and main argument.
