# Virtue Development Rubrics and Indicators

A framework for intentional character formation through observable indicators aligned with classical and Christian virtue traditions.

---

## Philosophy

### Why Virtue Education?

1. **Integral to classical education**: The goal is not just knowledge but wisdom and goodness
2. **Character is taught**: Virtue requires modeling, practice, and habit formation
3. **Academic and moral unity**: Knowledge without virtue is dangerous; virtue without knowledge is blind
4. **Community formation**: Shared virtues create school culture
5. **Lifetime preparation**: Character matters more than credentials

### Approach

**Not moralism**: We do not reduce virtue to rule-following or external compliance.

**Not relativism**: We affirm objective moral truth while acknowledging developmental growth.

**Growth-oriented**: We measure progress, not perfection; effort, not arrival.

**Grace-informed**: We recognize human weakness while calling students higher.

## Assessment Approach

### Principles

1. **Growth over perfection**: We measure progress, not arrival
2. **Process over outcome**: We value effort and intention
3. **Narrative over numbers**: Stories capture character better than grades
4. **Observation over testing**: Virtue is lived, not examined
5. **Encouragement over judgment**: We call students higher, not shame them

### Methods

#### Teacher Observation
- Daily interactions
- Classroom behavior
- Academic integrity
- Social situations
- Response to difficulty

**Documentation**:
- Anecdotal notes
- Incident records (positive and concerning)
- Pattern identification

#### Self-Assessment
- Reflection journals
- Goal-setting
- Progress evaluation
- Confession and commitment

**Sample Prompts**:
- "When did you show fortitude this week? When did you give up too easily?"
- "How did you demonstrate kindness? When were you unkind?"
- "What virtue do you want to grow in this quarter?"

#### Peer Input
- Anonymous encouragement
- Team evaluations
- Conflict resolution records

#### Parent Input
- Home behavior
- Character outside school
- Growth noticed

### Reporting

#### Elementary Report (Quarterly)

For each virtue area:
- **Strength observed**: Specific example
- **Growth area**: What to work on
- **Encouragement**: Affirmation

Example:
> **Fortitude**: Sarah persevered through her first long-division unit, asking for help when stuck but not giving up. She can grow in taking risks in class discussion—she often knows the answer but hesitates. Keep encouraging her to share her good thinking!

#### Middle School Report (Semester)

- Virtue self-assessment
- Teacher observations
- Specific goals
- Growth narrative

#### High School Report (Semester)

- Extended self-reflection
- Multiple teacher input
- Community service evaluation
- Leadership assessment
- Personal virtue goals

### Not Used

- Numerical grades for character
- Rankings or comparisons
- Public identification of struggles
- Punitive assessment
