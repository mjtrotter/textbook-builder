# Computer Science K-12 Progression

A developmental curriculum from digital citizenship through computational thinking to advanced programming, integrated with the classical curriculum.

---

## Philosophy

### Why Computer Science?

1. **Computational thinking**: Problem decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms are universal skills
2. **Creation over consumption**: Students should be creators of technology, not just consumers
3. **Ethical reasoning**: Technology requires wisdom about use, privacy, and human flourishing
4. **Future preparation**: Every field increasingly requires computational literacy
5. **Problem-solving**: Programming develops systematic thinking applicable everywhere

### Integration Philosophy

Computer Science is NOT just "typing class" or "computer lab." It is:
- **Tool for other subjects**: Use computation to explore math, science, language
- **Application of reasoning**: Programming is logic made tangible
- **Ethical domain**: Technology choices have moral implications
- **Creative medium**: Expression through code and digital creation
- **Progressive mastery**: Skills build systematically from K-12

### Classical Integration

Computer Science connects to classical education:
- **Grammar stage**: Learn syntax, vocabulary, basic patterns (like grammar)
- **Logic stage**: Debug programs, construct algorithms (like logic)
- **Rhetoric stage**: Create original solutions, evaluate technology (like rhetoric)
