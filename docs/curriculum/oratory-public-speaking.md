# Oratory and Public Speaking Curriculum

A comprehensive K-12 progression for developing confident, persuasive, and eloquent speakers through classical rhetoric and modern communication skills.

---

## Philosophy

### Why Oratory?

1. **Classical foundation**: Rhetoric is the capstone of the Trivium—the ability to express truth persuasively
2. **Leadership preparation**: Leaders must communicate vision, inspire action, and persuade
3. **Academic success**: Oral presentations, debates, and discussions are central to higher education
4. **Civic participation**: Democracy requires citizens who can argue, deliberate, and advocate
5. **Career readiness**: Public speaking consistently ranks as the most valued professional skill
6. **Confidence building**: Overcoming fear of speaking transforms students

### Integration Philosophy

Oratory is NOT a standalone "speech class." It is:
- **Integrated across subjects**: Present in every class, every day
- **Progressive skill development**: Building from simple to complex across grades
- **Connected to writing**: Speaking and writing are complementary skills
- **Rooted in content**: Students speak about what they're learning
- **Classical in method**: Following the progymnasmata tradition
